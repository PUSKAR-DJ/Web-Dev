        <p class="sectionSubTag test-small">The mastermind behind Minecraft's blocky universe is Markus "Notch" Persson, a Swedish programmer. Inspired by games like Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress, Notch sought to create a world where players could build and explore without limitations. The iconic character, Steve, was born from the need for a simple, pixelated avatar that fit the game's aesthetic. Initially, Notch considered a more complex character design but ultimately opted for the minimalist approach, a decision that has become synonymous with Minecraft's charm.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag test-small">In 2014, Minecraft's meteoric rise caught the attention of tech giant Microsoft, leading to a historic acquisition deal worth $2.5 billion. This marked a pivotal moment for the game, bringing it under the umbrella of a major corporation. The move raised eyebrows within the gaming community, with concerns about potential changes to the game's core values and creative freedom. However, Microsoft assured players that Minecraft's essence would remain intact, and the game continued to thrive under its new ownership.</p>
